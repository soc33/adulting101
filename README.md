# How it Works
When the user initially visits the site, they will be able to complete one quiz.  Once they create a profile, the remaining topics will be released.  Once they have successfully completed a quiz with an 80% or greater, they will be awarded a badge in that topic.

Successful completion of all nine topics and the user will be awarded an Official Adult Badge!
